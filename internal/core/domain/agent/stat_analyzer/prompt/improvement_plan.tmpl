{{define "ImprovementPlanPrompt"}}
Using the identified development areas from your performance data, craft a detailed **Improvement Plan** comprised of three distinct intervention categories per weakness. For each of the three weaknesses:

1. **Skill Drill**: Describe a targeted, measurable exercise that directly addresses the deficiency. Include:
   - **Duration** (e.g., 20–30 minutes)
   - **Specific Setup** (e.g., “use workshop mode with moving bots at varying speeds”)
   - **Performance Goal** (e.g., “achieve 90% hit accuracy on 100 sequential targets”)

2. **Analytic Reflection Ritual**: Outline a structured review protocol. Provide:
   - **Replay Scope** (e.g., “last five ranked matches”)
   - **Annotation Focus** (e.g., “note every death’s location, time, and teamfight impact”)
   - **Time Allocation** (e.g., “45 minutes total”) and **Deliverable** (e.g., “write a one-page summary of recurring decision points”).

3. **Mindset Conditioning**: Recommend a mental exercise to reinforce resilience and focus. Include:
   - **Pre-session Routine** (e.g., “two-minute breathing meditation with box breathing technique”)
   - **In-session Cue** (e.g., “visual trigger when tilt is detected”)
   - **Expected Outcome** (e.g., “reduce tilt incidents by 50% over next week”).

Format the plan as a clear, numbered list grouping exercises by weakness, with each exercise titled and bullet-pointed under its category. Conclude with a motivating statement that reinforces consistency, measurement, and data-driven growth.
